<p> the Northern Lights (Aurora Borealis):

The Northern Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis, are one of nature’s most mesmerizing phenomena. These vibrant displays of colored lights dance across the night sky, primarily seen in high-latitude regions near the Arctic Circle. Caused by charged particles from the sun colliding with gases in Earth’s atmosphere, the auroras shimmer in shades of green, purple, red, and blue. Historically, these lights have inspired myths and legends among indigenous cultures, often believed to be messages from the spirit world. Today, travelers from around the world flock to destinations like Norway, Iceland, and Alaska in hopes of witnessing this magical spectacle firsthand.
